# seminar3-iss

This repository is a collaborative exercise from our Software Systems Engineering seminar, where we explored Git branching, merging and conflict resolution through an interactive storytelling format inspired by **Choose Your Own Adventure** books. Each branch represents a *narrative path* based on the topic **Oppenheimer**, leading to different outcomes. 

A fun way to learn Git by building a non-linear story together.
